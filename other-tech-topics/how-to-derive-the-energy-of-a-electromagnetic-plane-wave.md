# How to derive the energy of a electromagnetic plane wave

Energy of a [E-M plane wave](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_%28OpenStax%29/Map%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics%2C_Electricity%2C_and_Magnetism_%28OpenStax%29/16%3A_Electromagnetic_Waves/16.03%3A_Plane_Electromagnetic_Waves#:~:text=The%20electric%20field%20shown%20is,propagating%20along%20the%20x%2Daxis.&text=The%20electromagnetic%20wave%20is%20therefore,to%20its%20direction%20of%20propagation.) on a detector:

$$
ε = ∫Pdt
$$

∵For a plane wave, `S` is constant over the area, so: 

$$
P =SA=(EH)A=(E(ϵcE))A=(ϵcE²)A \\
∴ε = ∫Pdt = ∫(ϵcE²)A·dt
$$

 ∵These are constants 

$$
∴ε = ∫(ϵcE²)A·dt = (ϵE²) ∫A·c·dt
$$

∵·`c·dt` is the length and A is the area 

∴`∫A·c·dt` gives a volume 

$$
∴ε = ϵE²·V
$$
