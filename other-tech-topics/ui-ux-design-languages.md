# UI/UX Design Languages

## **Skeuomorphism**

* **Definition**: the design concept of making items represented resemble their real-world counterparts. \([source](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/skeuomorphism)\)
* **Objective**: Familiarize users to digital interfaces by mimicking real-world objects.
* **Examples**: 
  * [Voice Memo](http://www.discoverforce5.com/sites/default/files/voicememo-app.png) app in iOS &lt;7.
  * [Gear composer](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/56e1ab893e691.jpg) in some music-composing app.
* Notice that Skeuomorphism does not simply mean _life-like visuals_. Such **anti-examples** include:
  * iOS &lt;7 settings page: No real-time object works like that.

## Trend in UI/UX Design Languages

In the past decade or two, UI/UX design languages have seen trends of **skeuomorphism -&gt; flat design -&gt; neumorphism**. Examples/evidences:

| Seen in... | skeuomorphism | flat design | neumorphism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Microsoft Windows | _Windows Media Player_ resembles the front panel of a DVD player. | _Metro UI_, later referred to as _Microsoft design language_. | _Fluent Design_, particularly because of its emphasis on "materials". |
| Google Android | Android 2 era: The clock widget is realistic; The handler on app drawers has "dots" for enhanced friction if it were in real life. | Android 4: Reminds me of _Tron_. | _Material Design_ |
| Apple iOS | Pre-7 era | 7~12 era | iOS 13 |

It is hard to classify _Metro UI_ and _Material Design_ as _flat design_ or _neumorphism_, mainly because both design languages make use of **depths**. _Metro UI_ employed a heavy dose of parallax effect, which implied a sense of depth; Although parallax effects are also seen in _Material Design_, drop shadows are more often used to hint on the depths of objects in Google's design language. Drop shadow, since at least Windows XP era, has been around in Microsoft Windows operating systems. Since both of the design languages shared the metaphor of z-axis depth, usage of such property may not warrant a clear separation between flat design and neumorphism.

A better clue might be the use of **materials**. Designs in Android 4 favored outlines with a neon-like glow, while Windows 8 got rid of the Aero glass effect that Windows 7 boasted. In their successors, _Fluent Design_ recommends the use of Acrylic translucency effects, and _Material Design_ focuses on the idea of floating/overlapping pieces of papers. I decided to take the usage of material metaphor as the criteria on whether a design language should fall into the category of flat design or neumorphism.
