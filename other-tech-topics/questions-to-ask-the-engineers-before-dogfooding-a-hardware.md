# Questions to ask the engineers before dogfooding a hardware

[Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) refers to the practice of a company's employees using unreleased products for quality control purposes. Here's a list of questions I ask the distributors \(often the engineers who made the device\) every time I dogfood a piece of hardware:

1. What is this **designed use case/scene**? Most [engineering prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_sample) come in an unassuming, plain, pitch-black look. Such design usually implies a business-oriented scenario, but this might not be the case for an [engineering sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_sample). Should I take the current visual appearance as the final design and take it into consideration during the dogfood period?
2. Is this device designed to be a **low-/mid-/highend** product? Products targeting different markets deserve different standards of evaluation. I would expect my latest Pixel phone / iPad pro to excel in every way, especially considering I paid quite a fortune out of pocket purchasing it. Since dogfooders do not pay anything for the device, this "monetary gauge" is absent. Engineers distributing these devices should inform dogfooders about the price tag, or at least the targeted market.
3. If this device meant to be a **replacement/direct competitor/successor** of some existing product? If so, what are they? This piece of information enables dogfooders to evaluate the device by comparing it horizontally \(if replacement or competitor\) / vertically \(if successor\) with its peers.
