# On Collecting WeChat Chat Logs from End Users

WeChat for Mac&Windows are able to back up chat history from phones to the computer. Unfortunately the chat history is encrypted in a SQLite db. 

According to [this](https://www.cnblogs.com/pieces0310/p/4216182.html) and various other Chinese articles, the password is based on the **IMEI** of the device as well as a **WeChat-internal UserID** that needs capturing network events to retrieve.I feel that this is too technical to ask an average user.

Alternatively, many third-party software provides the ability to export WeChat chat history, such as [Cok](https://www.coksoft.com/androidwechat.htm) and [this](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-convert-a-WeChat-conversation-to-a-text-file).
