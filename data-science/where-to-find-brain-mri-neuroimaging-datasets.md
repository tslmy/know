# Where to find Brain MRI / NeuroImaging Datasets?

## Where to find Brain MRI / NeuroImaging Datasets?

Aggregated from [this question](https://www.researchgate.net/post/where_can_i_get_the_MRI_Brain_image_database_for_research_purpose) on ResearchGate.

* **OpenNEURO** : [https://openneuro.org/](https://openneuro.org/) \(formerly [OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org/)\) - I would suggest starting with this.
* Connectome datasets -- A **connectome** \(/kəˈnɛktoʊm/\) is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain. \(via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome)\). Can contain **functional** connectivity and **anatomical** connectivity.
  * Human Connectome Project : [https://www.humanconnectome.org/](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) \(Sponsored by NIH; c.f. NDA\)
  * 1000 Functional Connectomes Project : [http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/fcpClassic/FcpTable.html](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/fcpClassic/FcpTable.html)
    * For Reliability and Reproducibility researches: [http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/index.html](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/index.html)
  * My Connectome Project - characterizes **changes over &gt;1 year** : [http://myconnectome.org/wp/](http://myconnectome.org/wp/)
* The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies \(OASIS\): [http://www.oasis-brains.org/](http://www.oasis-brains.org/)
  * See [this literature](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014902v1) for OASIS-3 dataset.
* University-based:
  * Center for Imaging Science, JHU: [http://www.cis.jhu.edu/data.sets/](http://www.cis.jhu.edu/data.sets/) \(high definition; **organized by cerebral regions**\)
  * Laboratory of NeuroImaging, USC: [https://ida.loni.usc.edu/](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/)
    * [Standardized MRI datasets](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-tool/standardized-mri-data-sets/), via [the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).
* SchizConnect: [http://schizconnect.org/](http://schizconnect.org/) - Aggregates datasets from the 5 websites: [fBIRN](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/fbirn/), [COINS](http://coins.mrn.org/), [XNAT Central](https://central.xnat.org/app/action/DisplayItemAction/search_value/NUDataSharing/search_element/xnat:projectData/search_field/xnat:projectData.ID), [NUNDA](https://nunda.northwestern.edu/nunda/data/projects/NMorphCH), and [NU REDCap](http://project-redcap.org/)
  * Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite \(COINS\): [https://coins.trendscenter.org/](https://coins.trendscenter.org/)
    * Backed by: _Mind Research Network_, a nonprofit 501\(c\)3 organization Partnered with Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute
  * 04/18/2020: 3 out of 5 data sources are down. I suggest manually browsing these sources if you so desire.
  * This website is developed at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) of USC. I wonder whether the collaborate with LONI \(see above\).

## Non-image data

There are other non-image data sources that might be of interest:

* Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals: [http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) \(EEGs only; no MRI\)
* ~~AD临床前期联盟, China :~~ [http://www.alzheimer.org.cn/app/files/index](http://www.alzheimer.org.cn/app/files/index) \(Presents no data.\)
* NBDC Human Database, Japan: [https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/) \(mainly DNA sequences obtained with _illumina dye sequencing_\)
* The National Institute of Mental Health \(NIMH\) Data Archive \(NDA\), USA: [https://nda.nih.gov/](https://nda.nih.gov/)
