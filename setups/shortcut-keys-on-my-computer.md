# ⌨️ Shortcut Keys on my Mac

With `command+v` set to pasting, as default on macOS, I set `shift+command+v` as clipboard history using [Clipy](https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy). The additional `shift` key requires your pinky.

One of my favorite is ``command+```, which toggles a fullscreen, transparent iTerm2 screen. It feels like a Quake console for cheating, but more awesome!

## Software Quick-Launch

Realized with [Snap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snap/id418073146?mt=12).

| Combination | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| `control+option+b` | Reeder |
| `control+option+n` | fs**N**otes |
| `control+option+m` | Microsoft Outlook |
| ``control+option+``` | Finder |
| `control+option+o` | Microsoft **O**neNote |
| `control+option+s` | **S**ublime Text 3 |
| `control+option+t` | **T**ypora |
| `control+option+z` | **Z**otero |
| `control+option+i` | **i**Term2 |

Why `control+option`, you ask? Because I can hit them with one finger.

## Combinations with the Space key

| Combination | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `control+space` | Spotlight |
| `option+space` | Alfred |
| `command+space` | rotates between [Sogou Pinyin](https://pinyin.sogou.com/mac/), built-in English keyboard, and [Google Japanese IME](https://www.google.co.jp/ime/). |
