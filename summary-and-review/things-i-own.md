# Things I Own

## Digital Gadgets

* **MacBook \(2015\)**: Portability is king. Trust me. I can go hiking with this bad boy.
* **iPad pro \(first gen\)**: For hand-writing/drawing and occasional YouTubing. Bought this for college. Served perfectly for the cause.
* **iPhone X**: Why not.
* **Apple Watch Series 4**: Fantastic for health tracking, weather tracking, and dictating reminders.
* **Sony WH-1000XM3 Headphones**: Best noise-canceling device I could purchase early 2019.
* **Gigabyte FORCE K83 Mechanical Keyboard**: My first mechanical keyboard. Great tactile, great price \(got for $50 from Amazon\).

I'm planning on the following purchases:

* **A latest Mac mini with highest configuration.** The tiny factor can be vastly appreciated when I relocate. It occurred to me that re-selling a full-factor desktop PC is not economically ideal, and I will always easily find a monitor and peripherals to plug in a Mac mini wherever I move to. 
* **Next-generation Airpods**. I loved my first gen and gave them to my dad. 
* Perhaps another **backpack**. My current one \(a [Herschel Pop Quiz](https://herschel.com/shop/backpacks/pop-quiz-backpack)\) is very out of shape after three years of abuse.

## Everyday Carry \(EDC\)

My **money clip** was repurposed from a [Modori Traveler's notebook pen holder](https://www.amazon.com/Midori-Travelers-notebook-holder-Brown/dp/B001D79A96). I always wrap a ID card with the bank notes. I never put my ID card together with a bank card.

For this reason, I have also a **wallet** in my backpack that holds bank cards \(credit cards, debit cards, etc.\) and extra cash. Very often I also have loyalty cards there. 

## Wears

I'm a loyal UNIQLO frequenter. Guess that's [why my date weren't always impressed](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/'he-wore-uniqlo-to-meet-me!'-japanese-woman-shares-petty-bad-date-story).
