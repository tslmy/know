# ðŸ“š Reading

After joining Google and life catching on a regular pace, I start to assume that I would have the capacity to read more after work.

Last weekend, I borrowed the only CFA curriculum book from the San Mateo Public Library. Unfortunately, the book is on Level II, and I could really use a more entry-level textbook. After browsing through official website of CFA, it turns out that I can get access to the ebooks of CFA Curriculum Level I by registering for the exam itself. When reading is tied to a test, there comes -- more or less -- pressure to read. You may argue that some pressure is healthy for pushing you to read at an actually productive schedule/pace, but I'm not very sure if that's suitable for my case, where I'm still struggling ramping up with work. In this consideration, I may as well pick up a tutorial book on Go lang, or TypeScript.
