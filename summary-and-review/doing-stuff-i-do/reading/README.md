# ðŸ“š Reading

After joining Google and life catching on a regular pace, I start to assume that I would have the capacity to read more after work.

Last weekend, I borrowed the only CFA curriculum book from the [San Mateo Public Library](https://www.cityofsanmateo.org/507/Library). Unfortunately, the book is on Level II, and I could really use a more entry-level textbook. After browsing through official website of CFA, it turns out that I can get access to the ebooks of CFA Curriculum Level I by registering for the exam itself. When reading is tied to a test, there comes -- more or less -- pressure to read. 

## Reading Work-related Books

You may argue that some pressure is healthy for pushing you to read at an actually productive schedule/pace, but I'm not very sure if that's suitable for my case, where I'm still struggling ramping up with work. In this consideration, I may as well pick up a tutorial book on Go lang, or TypeScript.

Speaking of work-related books: At my new office desk lies an unclaimed copy of Design Patterns. I asked around, and no one seemed to know its owner. I guess it's mine now.

I started reading the book, often at my desk while waiting for [automated tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation) to finish. My manager saw me, and further recommended me with a few more. They include:

* _Software Project Survival_ Guide, and
* _Refactoring_.

Both of the books are much easier to read than the _Design Patterns_, mostly because 1\) they did not involve an old programming language that I don't know of, and 2\) the use of first-person narrative made references much much clearer. Thanks to the ease, I finished the two by the beginning of December, feeling more confident about knowing what's going on at work.

## Reading Textbooks

Now that I have finished a couple of work-related books, it might be time to pick up one unrelated to software development. Because I had returned the CFA Curriculum book before it's due \(which I didn't found readable anyways\), this was also a chance to explore another subject.

Around the end of 2019, I picked up _Psychology_ \(11th Ed\), by David G. Myers and C. Nathan DeWall. Yes, it's a 900-page textbook, not a easy read like any of the 50+ lightnovels I devoured; but here's the beauty of textbooks: If you read them back-to-back without academic pressure \(exams, etc.\), it is one of the best ways to get a comprehensive and systematic view into a subject.

The last textbook I've read this way was _Introduction to Computational Materials Science_, during the summer right after my graduation from college and before my entering to the Scientific Computing master's program. I have to confess that I barely remember any detail from this book, but had I stayed in the program \(rather than transferring to Data Science within 3 weeks of joining UPenn\), the book-reading experience would surely be more valuable.
