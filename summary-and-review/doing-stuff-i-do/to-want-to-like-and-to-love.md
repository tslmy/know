## What's the difference between **to want** and **to like**?

The desire, "to want", comes **before** seeing someone/acquiring something/doing the activity. The enjoyment, "to like", comes **during** and/or afterwards. What's the difference?

* You can want someone but not like them.
  * You hate some co-worker, but you need them on board to complete your work at hand.
  * In a long-distance relationship, you want to see your significant other. You go to see them, and then realize that they don't look as attractive as you remember.
* You can want something but not like them.
  * In order to protect yourself from germs, you want hand sanitizers. However, it's hard to say that you like hand sanitizers.
  * I want my Form W-2 because I need to file my tax return, but I still hate paperwork.
* You can want some activity but not enjoy doing them.
  * I am hungry; I want food, but all restaurants are closed, so I cook. I want to cook, but I -- being a horrible cook -- still don't enjoy doing it.
  * Some people want to go to work so that they can be paid and then survive, but they do not necessarily enjoy it.

You can also like someone/something without wanting them. How so?

* I enjoy spending time with my significant other, but they are on another continent, and I'm too lazy to travel.
* I enjoy scrolling through social media, but I know it's a bad use of my time, so I don't want to do it.

## What's the difference between **to like** and **to love**?

When you like someone but don't necessarily love them, you enjoy spending time with them, but you probably won't do anything to make them live better. For example, I enjoy having my hair done by that one specific hairdresser, but I'll probably not help them with their lawn, buy them flowers, or give them extra money \(assuming we are in a no-tip culture\).

I can also like an object without loving it. For example, I enjoy playing video games on my 5-year-old laptop, but I have no regret tossing it into my bed, nor do I care if I accidentally scratched its surface -- It is so old that, if it breaks, I'lll happily go buy a new model.

The other way around: I can also love someone without liking them. Sometimes I feel that my parents are the case: They love me \(want me to be a better person, in terms of getting better educated\) but they don't like me \(enjoy having me at home, where I blast noisy music that annoys them\), so they sent me away for university. \(This is a joke.\)

## What's the difference between **to want** and **to love**?

When I love someone more than I want them, I want them to feel good even if that means I cannot have them by my side. If I figured that, by having my girlfriend move to where I live, she had to leave her hometown, which is the only place in the world she wants to spend the rest of her life, then I should not ask her to do so.

When I love something more than I want it, I want it to be in good condition if that means I cannot have procession of it. For example, if I win a bid for a masterpiece painting from the 1400s, but the moisture level in my living room is unsuitable for a old painting to preserve its vividity, then I'll voluntarily hand it off to a museum.
