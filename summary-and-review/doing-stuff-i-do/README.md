# Doing: Stuff I do

## Go-to List for things to kill time with

1. [~~Read books~~](reading/)~~. In fact, I am reading everyday, because it is very easy to insert a piece of reading time to your daily schedule.~~
2. ~~If you have ~$20 lying around and don't mind sending an hour writing addresses, send postcards to friends away. If you don't have friends away, try~~ [~~postcrossing~~](postcrossing.md)~~.~~

Let me simply make a table you can consult:

| Time-killers | $0 | ~$20 | ~$1000 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| &lt;1 hr | Read |  |  |
| ~3 hr | ~~Free hugs~~ Composing Music | Cook some ribs |  |
| 1 day |  | Write postcards |  |
| days |  |  | Travel |
