# ☕️ Coffee Brewing Equipments

Drinking coffee everyday does not necessarily mean you are a busy person; drinking _too much_ does. I was the latter case. Despite being short on time, I seeked higher quality than Starbucks and Keurig. Brewing my own coffee was the way to go.

I started with something dead simple: **cold brew**. You mix coffee powder with room-temperature water, refrigerate overnight, and filter away the powder. That's it. It's so simple that you don't even have to boil water. The most convoluted part in this recipe is perhaps the word _refrigerate_.

Not only is it simple, but also safe. Brewed with cool water, cold-brew coffee avoids the risk of sour taste due to water being unnecessarily hot. It also eliminates any potential danger of burning yourself, like I once did during a dull morning.

Notice how I have repeatedly used the term "simple", rather than "convenient", because it's not. A good cold brew that extracts adequately the favor from the coffee powder shall be left in the fridge for 4~12 hours. It's going to be a disappointment to found out that you had forgotten to prepare some last night in a dull morning. Then you must take the risk of possibly burning yourself with hot water.

If hot water is inevitable due to a poorly-scheduled, non-existent bottle of cold brew, you can always go with a **hand drip / pour-over**. For several months, I brewed my morning drinks this way as an alternative form of meditation, while listening to alternative news. 

This morning routine didn't last long, because, like I said, I was too busy for this.

Problem with busy person: they don't have time  for coffee to brew. I invested in a **french press**. I would brew my coffee in the french press for 5 minutes and filter away the powder. The improved process combined the wonderful flavor of french-press brews and excellent purity of a filtered drink. Best part: the process does not require much attendance. In an ordinary pour-over session, you would like your stream to go slowly, so that the essence of coffee powder can adequately infuse with the flowing water. This requires patience and a strong arm. In a combined session of french press and pour-over, though, since the infusion is already done in first step, you can feel free to simply dump all liquid into the filter.

For filtering, I always go with a fine-meshed stainless steel coffee filter. Pick one that has a stand, so that you can simply leave it on your cup and let coffee drain. The filter can double as a, well, filter for other kitchen applications, which is a plus. Speaking of other uses, a french press can also be used as a tea infuser. However, be advised that you might not be able to use a tea infuser as a french press, since a tea infuser might not have a "press" or a fine-enough filter.
