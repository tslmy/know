# Owning: Things I Own

## Digital Gadgets

These are the things I use:

* **MacBook pro 13" \(2020\)**: An upgrade from my MacBook \(2015\).
* **iPad pro \(first gen\)**: For hand-writing/drawing and occasional YouTubing. Bought this for college. Served perfectly for the cause.
* **Apple Watch Series 4**: Fantastic for health tracking, weather tracking, and dictating reminders.
* **Sony WH-1000XM3 Headphones**: Best noise-canceling device I could purchase early 2019.
* **Kinesis Advantage2 LF**: Best keyboard ever. Technically belongs to my company.
* **Apple AirPods Pro**: Immediately became my daily driver now.

### Backups

These are the stuff that I have replaced with other stuff but haven't had a great opportunity to get rid of them.

* **MacBook \(2015\)**: Portability is king. Trust me. I can go hiking with this bad boy.
* **Gigabyte FORCE K83 Mechanical Keyboard**: My first mechanical keyboard. Great tactile, great price \(got for $50 from Amazon\).

## Me and My Backpacks

In early 2016, I bought a [Herschel City Backpack](https://herschel.com/shop/backpacks/city-backpack-mid-volume?v=10486-03019-OS) while sightseeing with my mom in Toronto. It was stylish and convenient, but too small in volume to accommodate all my carryings as an undergrad.

In mid-2016, I bought a [Herschel Pop Quiz](https://herschel.com/shop/backpacks/pop-quiz-backpack) off a classmate for CAD$15. After 3 years of daily use, the backpack got extremely worn off. Sadly, I had to ditch it in September 2019.

Since then, I has been using a [Lenovo OA33911 backpack](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32333710465.html). It works for light trips in the bay area, but seems 1\) too heavy-duty for commuting \(I don't carry any laptop to/from work\) and 2\) not as stylish to carry to social occasions. As a matter of fact, I deliberately left it at home yesterday \(10/17/2019\) so that I didn't have to carry it to a mixer.

I'm considering buying another City Backpack, but in the meantime I heard of a potential free swag in next week's new employee orientation event. Might need to hold off for that! 

## Everyday Carry \(EDC\)

My **money clip** was repurposed from a [Modori Traveler's notebook pen holder](https://www.amazon.com/Midori-Travelers-notebook-holder-Brown/dp/B001D79A96). I always wrap a ID card with the bank notes. I never put my ID card together with a bank card.

For this reason, I have also a **wallet** in my backpack that holds bank cards \(credit cards, debit cards, etc.\) and extra cash. Very often I also have loyalty cards there. 

## Me and My Mattresses

The first mattress I could call my own was bought off from the previous tenant of the bedroom I leased from mid-2018 to mid-2019. The tenant, Y, happened to be an acquaintance and a schoolmate of mine. We later developed great friendship, and even started working at YouTube together.

During that year, I also received a free mattress from a visiting student, D, who was moving away. I hope all is well with D in Europe and her career.

The third mattress I own was bought off a fellow Googler, Z, for $208. By coincidence, Z got a refund for the seller, felt bad for keeping my $208, and Venmo-ed me back that amount. I ended up with another free mattress, as well as another friend. 

Z wanted to get rid of his mattress because he thought it was too soft, which [might induce backaches](https://www.us-mattress.com/will-a-soft-mattress-hurt-my-back.html). Indeed, my upper back hurt so much after spending a month on that mattress, so much so that I slept on the ground for about a week before my new mattress arrived. This new mattress felt much better, and it was also the first mattress that I purchased ever. 

Although that was my first mattress purchase, I did not research much into which mattress to buy before placing the order on Amazon. This might be a wrong move, considering that [1/3 of our life is spent on a mattress](https://daisylinden.com/mistakes-people-make-when-buying-a-mattress/), but I was in a mindset that [I would like to invest as little as possible into immobile goods](../being-what-i-am/being-minimalistic-and-mobile.md).

## Wears

I'm a loyal UNIQLO frequenter. Guess that's [why my date weren't always impressed](https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/'he-wore-uniqlo-to-meet-me!'-japanese-woman-shares-petty-bad-date-story). 

![Me in UNIQLO](../../.gitbook/assets/img_9769.jpg)

I'm thinking of buying a [customized](https://hallmadden.com/suits) \("tailored", "bespoke", "made-to-fit", or "fitted", you may say\) suit, mainly for attending a ceremony that falls in 3 weeks. Listed below are a few shops that I might visit. Sadly, the usual process time stretches to 3 months \(with the quickest turnout to be 6 weeks\), so I might have to stick with off-the-shelf \(i.e., pre-made\) ones if I so decided to buy one.
