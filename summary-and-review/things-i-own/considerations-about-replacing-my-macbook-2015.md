# Considerations about replacing my MacBook \(2015\)

A MacBook \(2015\) was my main rig.

**Degradation of MacBook battery.** The MacBook is showing some wear after 4 years of heavy use, especially on the battery. Around late 2018, I started to notice reduced capacity in the battery, and the battery icon in the menu bar started shouting "service battery" out of blue. In January 2019, I started monitoring remaining full charge capacity with CoconutBattery every so often. In December 2019, it happened for a couple of times that the battery dies with a remaining charge of 30% or 60%. Similar sudden deaths happened to my previous phone \(an iPhone 6, for your information\) after 3 years of use. Such incidents warrant a replacement in battery, which would mean a cost of $200. This might not sound awfully too expensive, but it might be avoided if I elect this old MacBook to be my new home server and keep it on its charger all day long.

**Is it a good idea to repurpose my MacBook as a home server?** Here's a few considerations:

* ✅ Its low power consumption is ideal for a personal server.
* ✅ Although deteriorating, the battery can serve as a UPS in case of short power outage. This is some enterprise-level feature an ordinary desktop cannot offer without extra purchase.
* ❎ I enjoy its portability. If I decided to leave it at home forever, what should I bring with me in case I want to do some computing outside of my room?
  * the next best choice for carrying would be my **iPad**. Can the iPad serve as a computer? Not if I cannot at least run \*nix programs on it. How to make it run \*nix programs?
    * ❎ Jailbreak: Some programs requiring x86 CPUs will not work.
    * ❓ Emulator: I'm [trying out iSH](../../setups/using-ipad-pro-as-a-linux-machine.md) for this reason. 
  * ❓ Can I buy **another laptop**? An immediate question is WHAT to buy.
    * **Another MacBook?**
      * ❎ A MacBook or a MacBook Air? Maybe try something else.
      * ❓ A MacBook pro 16'? 
        * ✅ Great performance.
        * ✅ Familiar macOS experience.
        * ❎ In terms of portability and \(lack of\) touchscreen, this device seems a better fit as a home server.
    * **A PC laptop?** Not until I can feel comfortable [using a linux desktop environment](../../setups/switching-from-macos-to-linux.md)!
      * ❓ A Dell XPS 13?

Or would I be better off getting the MacBook battery serviced and -- if I really want to -- buy another computer as a home server?

I'm debating on whether I should buy desktop PC, mainly serving as a home server. Due to mobility requirements, I am looking at tiny-factor machines. Some possible options include:

* **A latest Mac mini with highest configuration \($3,199.00\).** The tiny factor can be vastly appreciated when I relocate. It occurred to me that re-selling a full-factor desktop PC is not economically ideal, and I will always easily find a monitor and peripherals to plug in a Mac mini wherever I move to. OR:
