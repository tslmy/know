# Ear-/headphones I Owned

## My first pair of earbuds: Sennheiser MX500 Blue

I received my first pair of earphones in my sixth grade. Being too young at that time, I was neither able to tell the brand/model of those earphones, nor felt the need to take down any visual clue that I could research with after a few years. Many years later, when I was browsing aimlessly online, I bumped into an image of Sennheiser MX500 Blue, and I immediately recognized that those were the pair of earbuds I listened to everyday when I was much younger. 

Oddity is that, those earphones I owned were simply a gift that came with the purchase of a Chinese-branded electronic dictionary. It does not make sense to have a Sennheiser accompanying. Therefore, I suspect that those are fake ones. However, this does not explain why those earbuds sounded so good -- I could still remember the first night I listened with them: The song was _Close to You_ by Susan Wong, and I wondered in the corridor outside my condo, subconsciously, in search of a quieter corner so that I could take in all the details in the music. The sound quality was _that_ good, compared to bookshelf speakers I used to listen to. I would rather believe that I had an authentic pair of Sennheiser MX500.
