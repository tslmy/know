# ðŸ’» Custom PC Specs

## Middle-School-Era PC

Lying around in my home at China is a PC that I held dear the most during my six years of middle-to-high school era. I barely touched it anymore after entering college. Therefore, the computer was only "powerful" as I remembered it, till mid 2019 when I got home \(after two years aboard doing my master's; that's six years away from this PC\) and discovered just how outdated my old friend is.

Without further emotional reviews, here's the specs:

* **CPU**: [IntelÂ® PentiumÂ® Processor E5700](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/42801/intel-pentium-processor-e5700-2m-cache-3-00-ghz-800-mhz-fsb.html) \(2M Cache, 3.00 GHz, 800 MHz FSB\)
* **Motherboard**: Gigabyte [GA-EP45C-DS3R](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-EP45C-DS3-rev-10#ov) with BIOS version F5
  * **The on-board CMOS battery needs replacement.** With a power outage, the BIOS always falls back to a last-known-good configuration, which holds CPU running at 1.7GHz instead of 3.0GHz.
* **RAM**: 2x2GB.
  * _Need to figure out the manufacturer._
  * A relevantly newer pair of RAM modules does not work with this particular motherboard \(or CPU\). Maybe I just need to tweak the BIOS settings?
    * While we are on it: list of [compatible RAMs](http://download.gigabyte.cn/FileList/Memory/motherboard_memory_ga-ep45c-ds3.pdf) \(PDF\).
* **GPU**: Nvidia GeForce GTX 460. I just brighout this back from the USA to China, simply because I had that space in my luggage. 

## Philadelphia $200 Build

This is a PC I held for about 15 months when I was doing my graduate studies at Penn. While I have described in detail what this machine came into, let me repeat the specs here for the sake of centralized note-taking:

* **Optiplex 7010 MT**: A decent refurb I won from an eBay bidding with USD$70.
* _**Nvidia GeForce GTX 460**: A little piece of impulse shopping that I got for USD$30._
* _**Patriot 4GB DDR3 1600 RAM** x 2: Because the stock 4GB memory just won't suffice. USD$40._
* **Kingston SSDNow 30GB**: A cheap piece of Solid State Drive that I got for USD$10.
* **DELL S2209W Monitor**: A decent 1920x1080 display unit that I got from CeX before it ceased business from the US. I really liked them. $15.

I brought the GPU and the RAM modules back to China because I didn't wanted to waste the space in my checked luggages. They didn't turn out to be all compatible to my PC at home, it turned out.
