# Being a software developer

Vaguely, I have worked under three paradigms of software development:

* Open Source
* Exploratory / Academic / Data Analysis
* Enterprise / Corporate / Industry

## Open Source

Open Source Software \(OSS\) developers are like _knight-errants_. This metaphor is two-folded: For the better half, they make a piece of software, often targeting at an existing problem they see in their own or others' workflows, and make it publicly available. At the same time, those knight-errants also exhibit less interest in assuming prolonged responsponsibilities to their projects: Often, repos are abandoned, ill-documented, and/or nonfunctional at all. Worse, they trust their peers with keeping their dependencies reliable to such a degree that it almost renders OSS developers ignorant: My repo didn't compile because an upstream package is broken? Not my problem!

## Enterprise

Failed compiles might not trouble indie developers so much -- _It works for me_, we often hear them say. However, that would be a huge problem for a corporate setting. To tackle this problem, big companies usually organize packages in specific and strict ways. For example, at Google, all third-party packages are stored under one directory, and only one copy is allowed \([source](https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/)\). 

It is worth mentioning that, in academia, things are organized more similar to open-source projects compared to enterprise settings.

## Academic

...which brought us to the third "paradigm" I personally have experienced. In recent years, there are more and more conferences and scientific journals that nudge you towards open-sourcing your project's code along with your paper submission. In data-heavy areas, such as social media analysis, it is also recommended to publicate your datasets.
