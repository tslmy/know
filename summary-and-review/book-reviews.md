## How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems

An excellent book of reduction, in the sense of computability theory, without any computability theory. 

In these theories, "reduction" is the process of rewriting a problem into an equivalent problem that is already proven to be solvable. Just needs to be solvable; not necessarily simpler -- this is how the computer science version of reduction differ from the mathematics version. 

Usually, this implies an absurd and unnecessary complexification \(just like the word "complexification" itself.\) This reduction is seen throughout the book, often in the form of escalating everyday problems into rocket science. \(At times, literally rocket science.\) 

For example \(spoilers!\), want to dig a hole? Why not use industrial vacuum excavators? Archaeologists have been using them for years. Wanna send a file? Encode them in the DNA of butterflies -- Those little creatures are really good at migrating. Gotta charge your phone at an airport? Build a hydroelectric dam at the drinking fountain! Maybe adding a bit of college physics to everything sounded too much a waste for you; how about boiling the whole river to vapor with kettles so that you don't have to engineer a bridge? 

This book is really a fun read, as long as you don't try it at home.

## Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World

Another one of my impulse-buy-and-read experiences. I rate 3.5.

One of the book's keywords, _technochauvinism_, is the only reason that pushed me from hearing about the book to ordering a copy online.

As a student of Data Science, I was expecting more logical arguments and mathematical derivations that proved why AI won't always work, but I also gladly accepted the fact, as the preface stated, that this book is more like a collection of author's own stories regarding machine learning rather than a scientific paper. This made the book into my category of "fun reads," next to "Oreshura" and other light novels.

Also, it's entertaining to read about the school I'm currently studying at after getting bored with the chapter on US politics, a topic of which I couldn't care less as an alien.

## The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century

Fantastic read! Although it took me almost a year to finish, this book never bored me when I picked it up. It is more than a grammar book or a writing style tutorial: The author digs up stories, histories, and motivations behind different phenomena that is currently occurring in the English language. Iâ€™m very glad that I have read this book.
