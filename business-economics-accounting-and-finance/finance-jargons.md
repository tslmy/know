## Strategies

\(Simple\) [moving average \(SMA\) crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_crossover): Calculate rolling averages on different window sizes. Do something when they cross over each other.

[Long/short equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp): _take long positions_ in stocks you expect to raise that are expected to increase in value and _short positions_ in stocks that are expected to decline. [Long/short means](https://business.unl.edu/outreach/econ-ed/nebraska-council-on-economic-education/student-programs/stock-market-game/documents/The%20Long%20or%20Short%20P)...

* To **take long position** in a stock: Buy stocks at a low price; sell them when the price gets high. Used when you expect the stock to increase in value.
* To **take short position** in a stock: When you expect a stock to decrease in value, borrow some shares from your broker, sell the shares to other investors at the current price. When stock price decreases to a desired amount, buy in shares and return to broker.

## Returns

### DGTW return

* [Originally ](http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/rwermers/ftpsite/dgtw/dgtw.pdf)designed to evaluate how stock funds \("fund managers"\) are good in picking stocks and timing the market \([cite](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/10044)\).
* Can be used to evaluate non-deliberate stock-picking criteria, such as [Google trends](https://www3.nd.edu/~pgao/papers/Google_JF2011.pdf).

## Common Stocks/ETFs

### SPDR \("spider"\) funds

* A **family** of ETFs. \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDR)\)
* A **trademark** of _Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC_, a subsidiary of S&P Global.
* Designed to **track the S&P 500** index.
* A good **benchmark** [if you are primarily buying large cap US stocks](http://www.marketriders.com/investing/etf-stocks-can-you-beat-spy-how-to-benchmark-your-performance/).
* `NYSEARCA: SPY`  on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=NYSEARCA:+SPY) - "SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust"

### CBOE Volatility Index \([VIX](http://www.cboe.com/vix)\)

![Screenshot from http://www.cboe.com/vix](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

* Designed by the [Chicago Board Options Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp) \(CBOE\).
* Implies 30-day volatility from S&P 500 Index.
  * It's "implied" -- it does not directly measure the real volatility.
* Also available as options & futures.
* Not really ETFs in the common sense -- the VIX ETFs track _VIX **futures**_ instead.
  * This actually makes sense -- in this way, VIX is able to capture how traders expect the stock market to go.
