# Noogler 100: So you accepted Google's offer; what now?

![A Noogler hat.](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Congratulations on accepting the job offer from Google! You've got a few weeks \(or months\) of time before actually starting to work at Google, and you feel like to get prepared in advance. What can you do?

This list is assembled by Mingyang Li to help you familiarize yourself with Google's tech stacks and environments. Disclaimer: 

* **This is NOT an official Google product/article.** Always refer to your true Noogler onboarding trainings for accuracy.
* **Everything listed are public information.** In other words, I have not leaked sensitive or confidential information.

Now the actual content.

## Engineering Practices

* At Google, all **source code** need to be **peer-reviewed**. How to prepare for a smooth review, and how to actually give out reviews? [This official guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/) can be handy. 
* I wish the site above could have provided more information about **engineering practices** at Google. For now, I found [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01715.pdf) to be of great help.
* When proposing a new product/feature/etc., [Google requires **design docs**](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Google-write-software-requirements). Here is [a design doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14YBYKgk-uSfjfwpKFlp_omgUq5hwMVazy_M965s_1KA/edit) from the Chromium project, and it resembles much of Google's internal requirements for DDs. 
* You might have a few **personal projects** at hand, or you may be anticipating contributing to some **GitHub repos** after joining Google. If so, you definitely want to consult the [open-source contribution guidelines and policies](https://opensource.google/docs/) first.

## Technology

* What are some **open-source/non-Google alternatives to** each of many **Google-internal technologies**? [This lookup table](https://github.com/jhuangtw-dev/xg2xg) \(that was meant for those who quit Google to survive in the wild\) answers just that. 
* Google has, by far, developed 3 **container-management systems**. What are they, and how do they compare? Check out [this article](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444).
* What is **Midas Package Manager** \(MPM\)? Watch this wonderful [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJlTllziPI) and read the [slides](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/lisa_2014_talk.pdf).

## Life

* What is my **level**? How long does it usually take for one to level up? Am I paid well at my level? How does level system compare across tech companies? There is a [website](https://www.levels.fyi/) for that.
* Here are some [internal slangs](https://www.businessinsider.com/words-only-googlers-understand-2018-1).
