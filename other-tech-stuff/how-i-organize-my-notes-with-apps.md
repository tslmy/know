* `N/A` means "not my own work, thus does not apply."
* Numbers are on a 7-point scale.

### How I Allocate Apps to Different Note-taking Purposes

Crossed-outs are what I used to use but moved away from \(due to death of product, etc.\).

### Note-taking and Storage

* Course notes / meeting notes that better be hand-drawn: **Notability** \(iPad\)
* Diary, personal journal: ~~Day One~~ **OneNote**
* Course reviews and summaries: ~~Evernote~~ **Notability**, course-specific **folders**, and -- in cases that the notes may be shared -- my [**academic website**](http://seas.upenn.edu/~myli). 
* Scribbles, jots, etc.: A folder full of plain text/markdown files.
  * Synced with ~~Simplenote~~ Dropbox.
  * Read with ~~Notational Velocity, nvALT~~ **fsNotes**.

### Editors and Word Processors

* Coding/writing temporarily - **Sublime Text**
* Quickly generating PDFs from Markdown - ~~Mou~~ **Typora**
* Academic writing \(essay, things with a formula/equation, etc.\) - **LyX**
* For language-checking - **Hemingway Editor + SlickWrite**
* Mind-mapping - **MindNode** 
* \(Math stuff excluded\)
* \(Office suites excluded\)
* \(Reminder and Calendar excluded\)
* \(Rare-format editors excluded\)

### ~~Cloud Storages~~

* ~~Mobile Syncing - Dropbox~~
* ~~Google Office - Google Drive~~
* ~~Microsoft Office - OneDrive~~
* ~~Backup - Box~~
