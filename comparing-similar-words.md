## Science

### Resonance and Inductive Effects

There are two main electronic effects that substituents can exert:

* RESONANCE effects are those that occur through the p system and can be represented by resonance structures. These can be either electron donating \(e.g. -OMe\) where p electrons are pushed toward the arene or electron withdrawing \(e.g. -C=O\) where p electrons are drawn away from the arene.
* INDUCTIVE effects are those that occur through the s system due to electronegativity type effects. These too can be either electron donating \(e.g. -Me\) where s electrons are pushed toward the arene or electron withdrawing \(e.g. -CF3, +NR3\) where s electrons are drawn away from the arene.

### "Thermodynamic reaction control" v.s. "Kinetic reaction control"

#### COMMON PROPERTIES

decide the composition of the product mixture of a reaction when:

* competing pathways lead to different products
* the reaction conditions influence the selectivity

#### Thermodynamic reaction control

* Favors the thermodynamic product - the one with the lower internal energy.
* Advantage in competition: product is more stable \(due to lower U\).
* favored in lower temperature \(where the Ea barrier cannot be easily overcome\).
* goes the thermodynamically-controlled pathway
* e.g.: 1,4-addition of HBr to Dienes

#### Kinetic reaction control

* Favors the kinetic product - the one with the lower kinetic energy.
* Advantage in competition: goes faster \(due to lower Ea\).
* favored in high temperature \(where the Ea barrier can be easily overcome\).
* goes the kinetically-controlled pathway
* e.g.: 1,2-addition of HBr to Dienes

### Eigenvectors v.s. eigenvalues

~~For rhyming, the "feature vector" is hereinafter referred to as "eigenvector".~~

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to describe a linear transformation.

The eigenvector describes the direction in which the direction does not change after the linear transformation is applied. The eigenvalues describe how much the vector will be stretched/compressed \(as a scaling factor\) in the direction above \(the one that does not change direction after the linear transformation\).

in case 

* V and W are finite dimensional, and
* There are selected bases in these spaces, 

Then: all linear transformations from V to W can be represented as matrices.

Under certain conditions \(such as a linear transformation whose matrix form is a real symmetric matrix\), the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can fully represent a linear transformation.

为了押韵，以下将“特征向量”称作“本征矢”。

本征矢 和 本征值 是用来描述一个线性变换的。

本征矢 描述了：作用该线性变换后，方向不会发生改变的方向。 本征值 描述了：上述（作用该线性变换后，方向不会发生改变的那个）方向上，向量会被拉伸/压缩多少（可以当作缩放系数来看）。

如果 

*  V 和 W 是有限维的，并且 
* 在这些空间中有选择好的基， 

则：从 V 到 W 的所有线性变换可以被表示为矩阵。

一定条件下（如其矩阵形式为实对称矩阵的线性变换），本征矢 和 本征值 可以完全表述一个线性变换。
