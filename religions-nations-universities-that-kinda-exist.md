# Religions, Nations, Universities that kinda exist

[Macronesia](https://macronesia.com) is a nation without territory. If you want, you can [apply for citizenship](https://macronesia.com/immigration/) and get "approved" right away. I genuinely suspect that the only verification Check out the [list of states](https://macronesia.com/states/) in Macronesia. If I had to choose, I'll move to New Zenland, just for the good pun.

In the state of Dudeland resides many believers of [Dudeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudeism), a religion that preaches nothing but chilling. Their state flag is a combination of the Tai-chi symbol and a bowling ball, which is cool. If you want, you can get [ordained](https://dudeism.com/ordination/) at their website, [_Church of the Latter-Day Dude_](https://dudeism.com).

Personally, I was ordained through the [Universal Life Church](https://www.ulc.org). I became a minister with a specific reason: I wanted to officiate my friends' wedding. I would sincerely doubt why a true dudeist, who should (characteristically) chill at the last row of the wedding ceremony with eyes fixated on the champagne fountain, would want to be ordained.

Here's a quote from _What is Dudeism_:

> The originator of Taoism, Lao Tzu, basically said “smoke ’em if you got ’em” and “mellow out, man” although he said this in ancient Chinese so something may have been lost in the translation.

I **could** play my culture card and clamor that Lao Tzu definitely didn't say that, but, Dudeism, right?

If Dudeism sounded too superficial, or you're simply not ready to convert, [the Little Creek Monastery](https://www.littlecreekmonastery.com) might be for you. The monastery has accumulated a rich repository of [poems, stories](https://medium.com/river-mushin), and essays. If you envision dudeists to be coach potatoes with a beer in hand, watching football all day long, consider the monks and nuns at the monastery -- in their own words -- "fellow travelers sharing insights into a calmer, more relaxed way of living".

Among their monastic vows of silence, I particularly enjoy this one:

> Breaking the vow is strictly prohibited — unless you have something to say.

There. I've just taken a 5-second vow of silence.

Let me wrap this up with [Abide University and Institute](https://aui.me), a higher education institution that offers instant honorary Ph.D. degrees. How cool is that! I wish they offered free `.edu` email addresses, so that I could exploited student discounts from online services.

I'm curious why there aren't any virtual-only corporates that offer jobs with no workload nor pay. That sounded a lot of fun to me, before I realized that such entities are probably illegal: People might exploit these "employments" and solicit social benefits. Strangely, the more I think about illegal all-employment-no-work companies, the more realistic they sounded.
