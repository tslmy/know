# ðŸŒŒ Finding our galaxy in layers of extragalactic structures

## Layers with unobservable boundaries

Let's get these out of our way first.

* **Multiverse**: a hypothetical group of multiple universes. \[^3]
  * **Universe**: all of space and time and their contents, forms of matter and energy.
    * **Observable universe**\[^1]: The observable universe: Everything possibly detectable from Earth under the physical limit due to _speed of light_.

\[^3]: "Some have argued that the multiverse is a [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical) notion rather than a [scientific hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) because it cannot be empirically [falsified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)." I agree.

## Types of extragalactic structures

**Cosmic void**: Vast space between filaments (the largest-scale structures in the universe), which contain very few or no galaxies.

**Galaxy filament**: Largest known structures in the universe. Consists of walls of gravitationally bound galaxy superclusters. Filaments serve as the boundaries between large voids. Subtypes:

* supercluster complexes,
* galaxy walls, and
* galaxy sheets

**Supercluster**: A large group of smaller _galaxy clusters_ or _galaxy groups_.

**Galaxy cluster**: A collection of galaxies larger than groups that are first-order clustering.

**Galaxy group** / group of galaxies (GrG): \~50 gravitationally-bound galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way.

**Galaxy subgroup**: A significant galaxy plus its satellite galaxies. A galaxy subgroup does not have to be a subset of a galaxy group; it may be that of a galaxy cluster. ([Source](http://astro.vaporia.com/start/galaxysubgroup.html))

**Galaxy**: a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Usually has a nucleus.

## Find the Milky Way through layers

In our universe, there is a...

* **Local Hole** / KBC Void: (debatable -- Not as empty as other voids)
  * Perseusâ€“Pegasus Filament
  * **Piscesâ€“Cetus Supercluster Complex**: A filament.
    * The Pisces-Cetus Supercluster
    * The Perseus-Pegasus chain
      * Perseus-Pisces Supercluster
    * The Pegasus-Pisces chain
    * The Sculptor region
      * Sculptor Supercluster
      * Hercules Supercluster
    * **Laniakea Supercluster**: A new (2014) definition of "the local supercluster" (LSC or LS) using the relative velocities of galaxies.
      * Hydraâ€“Centaurus Supercluster
        * the Great Attractor, Laniakea's central gravitational point near Norma
        * Antlia Wall, known as Hydra Supercluster
        * Centaurus Supercluster
      * Pavoâ€“Indus Supercluster
      * Southern Supercluster
      * **Virgo Supercluster** (Virgo SC): An old definition of "the local supercluster".
        * **Local Sheet**\[^2]: where galaxies share a similar peculiar velocity. Delineate one wall of the Local Void (not to be confused with the Local Hole).
          * **Local Group**: The group that includes the Milky Way. Contains >20 galaxies. ([source](https://www.britannica.com/place/Local-Group))
            * Andromeda subgroup: Andromeda galaxy (M31) + >=13 dwarf galaxies around it.
            * **Milky Way subgroup**: Milky Way + >=59 small galaxies around it.
              * **Milky Way**: Our galaxy.
                * Orion Arm
                  * Gould Belt
                    * Local Bubble
                      * Local Interstellar Cloud
                        * Solar System
                          * Earth

There's a rather ad-hoc (meaning, specific to our local environment) concept that is worth mentioning --

**The Local Volume**: the sphere of radius 10 Mpc centered on the Local Group. Contains 500+ galaxies. Includes:

* Local Group
* Sculptor Group
* Centaurus A group

[(Source](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/LVmeeting/science\_case.html))

As you can see, it spans across several superclusters, so I can't fit it in the tree representation above.

\[^1]: The universe is bigger than the observable universe, because if you were anywhere else, you would see a part of the universe that not observable on Earth, simply because the light there was able to travel to **you** rather than Earth at the present moment. \[^2]: That probably makes itself a filament (although small), but I can't find reference that attests "the local sheet is a galaxy filament".
