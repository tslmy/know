# Today I Learned/Achieved



![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Each New Years Day during my middle school era, I would review what I have done for the past year, trying my best to summarize into one sentence for each day, and post online. With life complexity shooting up, I stopped making annual reviews. 

Recently, I have read about [Julia Evans' suggestion of keeping a "brag document"](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) at work. Sounds like fun! 

For privacy concerns, I will focus on **skill level-ups** and **achievements** like such in this document, instead of jotting down every life event. 

Here we go.

* **190810**: Data exploration of footnote project yielded a preliminary result. Learnt a lot about [clustering documents without supervision](../data-science/clustering-documents-unsupervisedly.md) during the process. 
* **190811**: Set up my first-ever [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). This is meant for my side project of learning time-series DBMS.
* **190812**: Set up my first-ever [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) agent for scraping [AlphaAdvantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). 
* **190812**: Learned to use [Reason Compact](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004), an iOS app for creating music. Composed a short demo, [Candy Jar](https://soundcloud.com/tslmy/candy-jar), with it.
