## Science

### Polygon Rule, Huckel's Rule, bonding and antibonding

molecular orbitals \(MOs\), aromaticity

#### How to utilize the Polygon Rule and Huckel's Rule in practice:

```text
For a 6 annulene:
    By Polygon Rule: it has floorToOddNumber(6/2) => [3] bonding MOs. 
    By Huckel's Rule: 6 = 4*[1] + 2 => suggests AROMATIC
    ([3] - 1)/2 = [1]
```

※ remember that annulene is only applicable to the annulenes.

#### How to interpret aromaticity in terms of MO Theory:

Consider cyclohexane \(C6H12\):

```text
    Originally, each carbon atom has 2 p e-'s - that's 6*2 = 12 pi e-'s in total.
    According to the Polygon Rule: Its "energy diagram" should be a hexagon, opening 6*2 spots for e-'s to settle in.
    ∵12 pi e-'s = 12 spots in the polygon ∴The polygon should appear "all occupied", including all the bonding and anti-bonding "MOs".
    We noticed that the cyclohexane has no pi bond. (Does "anti-bonding" mean "canceling the bonding effect of the bonding MOs"?)
```

Now consider the \[6\]annulene \(a.k.a. "benzene"\):

```text
    One of the requirements for Huckel's Rule suggests that the molecule should have a continuous cyclic repetition of pattern "C-C=C", which actually reduces 1 e- from each C.
    So, the total amount of pi e-'s in benzene = 6*2 - 6*1 = 6
    It's just enough to fill up all the 3 bonding MOs.
    (We observed 3 pi bonds in the benzene molecule. Does this suggests a "bonding MO" represents a pi bond in the molecule?)
```

Now consider cyclohexa-1,3-diene \(benzene with one C=C bond reduced by H atoms\):

```text
    2 additional pi e-'s compared to benzene
    [Polygon Rule] the 2 additional e-'s are placed separately on the 2 degenerate LUMOs in the benzene diagram. Imagine these 2 e-'s are placed together in one of these LUMOs - an anti-aromatic MO is filled, so the molecule structure should have one pi bond less than benzene - and it truly is so.
    [Huckel's Rule] 8 = 2*4 ===suggests===> anti-aromacitiy <===because that=== we are having 2 MOs with only 1 e- in each (can be proven by Polygon Rule), which makes up a "di-radical" structure.
```

#### Conclusion

```text
The bonding/anti-bonding of the MOs - gives the amount of pi bonds in the molecule (just atom-and-atom bonds; not "pi conjugated system"):
    a filled bonding MO suggest one more pi bond        a filled anti-bonding MO suggest one less pi bond   The Aromaticity - all about the stability and reactive electrons: 
    anti-aromaticity: has lone e-'s. They are likely to escape/grab e-'s from other molecules (a.k.a. "reactive"), thus making it very hard for this molecule to stay itself (a.k.a. "unstable").
    aromaticity: has no lone e-'s. Every pi e- are paired in the MOs ,leaving no e-'s wandering about and causing troubles. It's not likely that this molecule change its structure, thus it has a high stability.
```

### Resonance and Inductive Effects

There are two main electronic effects that substituents can exert:

* RESONANCE effects are those that occur through the p system and can be represented by resonance structures. These can be either electron donating \(e.g. -OMe\) where p electrons are pushed toward the arene or electron withdrawing \(e.g. -C=O\) where p electrons are drawn away from the arene.
* INDUCTIVE effects are those that occur through the s system due to electronegativity type effects. These too can be either electron donating \(e.g. -Me\) where s electrons are pushed toward the arene or electron withdrawing \(e.g. -CF3, +NR3\) where s electrons are drawn away from the arene.

### "Thermodynamic reaction control" v.s. "Kinetic reaction control"

#### COMMON PROPERTIES

decide the composition of the product mixture of a reaction when:

* competing pathways lead to different products
* the reaction conditions influence the selectivity

#### Thermodynamic reaction control

* Favors the thermodynamic product - the one with the lower internal energy.
* Advantage in competition: product is more stable \(due to lower U\).
* favored in lower temperature \(where the Ea barrier cannot be easily overcome\).
* goes the thermodynamically-controlled pathway
* e.g.: 1,4-addition of HBr to Dienes

#### Kinetic reaction control

* Favors the kinetic product - the one with the lower kinetic energy.
* Advantage in competition: goes faster \(due to lower Ea\).
* favored in high temperature \(where the Ea barrier can be easily overcome\).
* goes the kinetically-controlled pathway
* e.g.: 1,2-addition of HBr to Dienes

### Eigenvectors v.s. eigenvalues

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="English" %}
~~For rhyming, the "feature vector" is hereinafter referred to as "eigenvector".~~

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to describe a linear transformation.

The eigenvector describes the direction in which the direction does not change after the linear transformation is applied. The eigenvalues describe how much the vector will be stretched/compressed \(as a scaling factor\) in the direction above \(the one that does not change direction after the linear transformation\).

in case 

* V and W are finite dimensional, and
* There are selected bases in these spaces, 

Then: all linear transformations from V to W can be represented as matrices.

Under certain conditions \(such as a linear transformation whose matrix form is a real symmetric matrix\), the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can fully represent a linear transformation.

{% tab title="Mandarin Chinese" %}
为了押韵，以下将“特征向量”称作“本征矢”。

本征矢 和 本征值 是用来描述一个线性变换的。

本征矢 描述了：作用该线性变换后，方向不会发生改变的方向。 本征值 描述了：上述（作用该线性变换后，方向不会发生改变的那个）方向上，向量会被拉伸/压缩多少（可以当作缩放系数来看）。

如果 

*  V 和 W 是有限维的，并且 
* 在这些空间中有选择好的基， 

则：从 V 到 W 的所有线性变换可以被表示为矩阵。

一定条件下（如其矩阵形式为实对称矩阵的线性变换），本征矢 和 本征值 可以完全表述一个线性变换。
