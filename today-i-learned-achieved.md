# Today I Learned/Achieved

Update late 2019: Now that I started working in a company, things I learn on a daily basis seem all to be more or less confidential. This document might not be as frequently updated.

Each New Years Day during my middle school era, I would review what I have done for the past year, trying my best to summarize into one sentence for each day, and post online. With life complexity shooting up, I stopped making annual reviews.

Recently, I have read about [Julia Evans' suggestion of keeping a "brag document"](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) at work. Sounds like fun!

For privacy concerns, I will focus on **skills** and **achievements** like such in this document, instead of jotting down every life event.

Here we go.

* **190810**: Data exploration of footnote project yielded a preliminary result. Learnt a lot about [clustering documents without supervision](data-science/text-mining/clustering-documents-unsupervisedly.md) during the process. 
* **190811**: Set up my first-ever [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). This is meant for my side project of learning time-series DBMS.
* **190812**: Set up my first-ever [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) agent for scraping [AlphaAdvantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to an [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/). 
* **190812**: Learned to use [Reason Compact](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004), an iOS app for creating music. Composed a short demo, [Candy Jar](https://soundcloud.com/tslmy/candy-jar), with it.
* **190831**: Ran my first [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) [AutoML Tables](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/quickstart) model for the _pltns_ project.
* **190901**: Made another short melody, [Me Gegavere](https://soundcloud.com/tslmy/me-gegavere), with [Reason Compact](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004).
* **190904**: Built my first Docker compose file on top of [influxdata/sandbox](https://github.com/influxdata/sandbox).
* **190906**: Figured out how to install `auto-sklearn` on macOS for the recent versions.
