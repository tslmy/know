## About Mingyang Li

I'm building the search engine at eBay. I'm also an ex-googler from the YouTube Data team.

Education-wise, I earned my Master's degree in [Data Science](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/mingyang-li/) from [U of Penn](https://home.www.upenn.edu/).

* While at Penn, I worked at [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) \(WRDS\) as a research associate. There, I built pipelines for parsing **SEC filings** into sectionized plain text.
* In my master's **thesis** and [several other publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rSJ_vnYAAAAJ), I compared people's perceptions of Emojis and \(im-\)politeness strategies across countries. These papers were completed under the [World Well-Being Project](http://www.wwbp.org/) \(WWBP\), Positive Psychology Center \(PPC\) of Penn.

Before Penn, I received [two Bachelor's degrees](https://uwaterloo.ca/science-2-plus-2/future-students/programs-and-courses) studying [nanomaterials](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/materials-and-nanosciences).
